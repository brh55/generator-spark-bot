> `generator-spark-bot` is a [yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) generator that scaffolds out a node Cisco Spark bot following an `event-driven` fashion, and is extremely easy to get started with.
>
> **trigger context => callback()**

Designed with simplicity and usability in mind:
- Fast to get started, just drop a `.js` file within `/commands` and your bot will register a listener on start
- Easier unit testing with access to commands' private methods
- Includes Flint for a more robust framework

## Usage
Ensure yeoman is is installed:

`npm install -g yo` or `yarn global add yo`

After yeoman is installed:

```bash
$ mkdir project-name
$ cd project-name
$ yo spark-bot
```

## Commands

Commands will instruct the bot on when and how to respond to particular contextual triggers.

To add a command, simply add a `.js` file within the commands directory. When the bot is initializing, commands will automatically register with Flint at runtime.

These command must implement an interface that contains a `trigger` property and a `callback` method. Refer to `example.js` within the commands directory.

#### trigger | [`<RegEx>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions), [`<string>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type)

The contextual trigger that will cause the bot to execute the callback upon matches.

#### callback | [`<function>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions)

The function to be executed (event handler).

## Command Sub-generator
`yo spark-bot:command`

For convenience, the `:command` sub-generator will generate a new command within the `/commands` directory.

## Scripts

- `npm run test` - Run linter and unit test
- `npm start` - Start the bot
- `npm run debug` - Activate debugging to log

## Unit Testing
Unit testing is straightforward, simple, and already configured with the AVA test runner. Commands are accessible through the `fileName` as a property of the `commands` object. Thus, any command callbacks can be tested as such: `commands.fileName.callback`.

In addition, the `rewire` module is pre-configured to test private methods and is easily accessible without the need of exporting any private methods. This is done with the `__get__()` method. IE: `commands.example.__get__('buildExampleMessage')`.
